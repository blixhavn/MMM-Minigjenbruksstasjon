# MMM-Minigjenbruksstasjon

This is a tiny, simple module for [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://magicmirror.builders/), mostly for my own convenience. If you're living in central Oslo, you might be far from regular recycling stations. In these cases, mobile recycling stations are regularly placed on specific locations. This is simply a module to notify you if such a station is deployed. Uses simple configuration to indicate placement, as no API is availble, and scraping the information seems cumbersome.

## Installation


## Installation

Enter your MagicMirrorÂ² module folder, e.g.:

    cd ~/MagicMirror/modules

Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/blixhavn/MMM-Minigjenbruksstasjon.git

Add the module to your configuration file, for instance:

    {
        module: "MMM-Minigjenbruksstasjon",
        position: "top_right",
        config: {
            dayOfWeek: "monday",
            timeFrom: "18:00",
            timeTo: "19:30"

        }
    },

## Configuration options

You can find your closest recycling station [here](https://www.oslo.kommune.no/avfall-og-gjenvinning/alle-gjenbruksstasjoner/), and read its opening hours from there. As far as I could see, all mobile recylcing stations are open on a specific day of the week. If this is not the case, feel free to make a PR to support your specific case, or make an issue on GitHub.
